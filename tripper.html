                        <p class="card-text">Students of the University of Toronto UX/UI bootcamp were challenged to
                            develop an app for travellers to use after the COVID-19 pandemic.
                            Tripper connects travelers who can share their thoughts, feelings and experiences about any
                            destination. They can send a message to anyone, anytime, and anywhere to let others know
                            what is happening now in world that is in constant change. Users can explore the world while
                            staying informed with a trusted community content.</p>
                        <h4>My Role</h4>
                        <p class="card-text">This solo project was completed during a 4 week sprint. I individually
                            performed user research, brainstorming, wireframing, prototyping and usability tests.</p>

                <h4 class="subHeader">User Research</h4>
                <p class="card-text">The first step of the process was understanding what travellers pain points are. To
                    gather relevant information, I sent a Google Forms survey to fellow classmates and friends to find
                    people who have <strong>travelled at least once</strong> during the pandemic, either domestically or
                    internationally.
                    5 participants were selected from that survey. I asked each participant <strong> 10
                        questions</strong> about their experiences to
                    get a better perspective about the target audience:</p>
                <ol class="questions">
                    <li>In your survey you said you have traveled during the pandemic. Where did you go and how was the
                        trip?</li>
                    <li>What were you worried about the most when organizing the trip?</li>
                    <li>What did you use to organize your trip? (booking, itinerary)</li>
                    <li>Why did you choose (chosen tool)?</li>
                    <li>Did your booking tools give you any COVID based information about your destination?</li>
                    <li>How were you able to access your trip information upon traveling? (i.e. checking flight times
                        before departing/the day of departing)</li>
                    <li>How did you feel using (said tool)?</li>
                    <li>How did you check for travel restrictions and requirements for entry for the location you
                        visited?</li>
                    <li>Why did you choose (said tool)?</li>
                    <li>How did you feel using (said tool)?</li>
                    <li>What could have made your trip organizing experience better/easier?</li>
                    <li>How do you feel about traveling once the pandemic settles?</li>

                <p class="card-text">Based on our user research, data suggests travelers will use social media and
                    word-of-mouth information to know more about their next travel destinations. Using government
                    websites or checking for news sources can sometimes be confusing to understand.</p>
                <p class="card-text">I brainstormed POV statements in the form of I Like, I Wish, What if? to get
                    perspective on what Julia might need to make her travel experience safe. Dot voting was conducted
                    with classmates to see what they would want for the app.</p>

                <h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
                <p>To get a better insight into the app market for social media and travel, I focused on analyzing
                    <strong> Twitter, Expedia, and TripAdvisor.</strong> I've identified these apps as potential
                    competitors because
                    they have similar features that Tripper would have.
                </p>

                <p>Through my research, I have found there was a lack of COVID-19 support on Expedia and TripAdvisor
                    for hotels, flights, and travel destinations. Users would have to do their own research on
                    safety guidelines. Twitter has issues with unverified sources spreading potentially false
                    information. Constant ads made the browsing experience annoying.</p>

                <p>I created flows for the onboarding process and 3 key features. The first feature is searching for a
                    channel for hotels and sending a message in the chat. The second is for creating a new channel. The
                    third feature is for writing a review.</p>

                <p class="card-text">This project has given me a first glimpse at the process of designing a new app
                    from research to design. As someone who hasn't travelled in a long time, it was difficult to
                    determine what objectives I wanted to focus on. After conducting interviews, I was able to empathize
                    with the pain and frustrations people have had while travelling during these uncertain times. People
                    want social interaction because it makes them feel comfortable knowing others are experiencing
                    similar issues. News sources and governments may not have that personal relationship with the public
                    compared to friends and family.</p>
